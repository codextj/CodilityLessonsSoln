//code in Version 1 PermMissingNumV1.java is more readable so PLEASE READ PermMissingElemV1.java code first

/*algorithm is same as previous version V1 only some minor changes mentioned below to try to increase performance but I think perfromance 
benefits are almost negligiable AS BOTH THE VERSION SCORED 100% in performance*/

/*--------trying to reduce usage of array.length by saving its value to variable, idk whether it has performance advantage or not---------
--------also instead of retrieving value of element from array we can simply generate it as element sequence follows pattern------------*/
