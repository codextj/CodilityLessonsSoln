	since frog can either jump or not jump dist D,noOfJumpReqToReachOrCrossY must be a integer 
	therefore if it comes out to be in decimal for eg 2.5 ie 2.5 is minNo. of jump required to cover the actualDistance, 
	we would roundUp 2.5 to 3 as if we roundDown frog would not be able to cover the actualDistance and hence not able to cross/reach Y so to make sure frog do we roundUp
	
	ps: either make X , Y, D double or use cast to double else Math.ceil doesn't work properly
